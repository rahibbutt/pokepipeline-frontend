# Pokepipeline-frontend
Pokepipeline-frontend is a single-page production-ready application built with Vue.js 3 and styled using Tailwind CSS. The app fetches PokÃ©mon data from the [pokepipeline-backend](https://github.com/rahibbutt/pokepipeline-backend) via [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and displays it in a responsive, user-friendly interface.
